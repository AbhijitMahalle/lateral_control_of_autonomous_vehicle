**Goal**  
  
  The purpose of this project was to write a detailed technical report on the research paper "[Lateral Control of an Autonomous Vehicle](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8286943)."   
The paper was published in IEEE on June 2018 by Jingjing Jiang and Alessandro Astolfi. The report includes explanation of main technical results along with affiliated proofs and simulation results.  
 
The research paper discusses and explains the design of a controller for a nonlinear under-actuated systems using the principles of backstepping and feedforward. A controller is designed for a car to control its lateral movement on straight and curved roads using the concept of preview point. The results of the controller are compared with the driver model.
